### Building a scene
It was a great way for me to learn to use the Unity UiToolkit which is based on XML and pseudo CSS, something i've been doing since 2015.
I invested in creating fluid animations that would mimic a visual novel and teach the player to recognize transitions and good / bad choices, and get dopamine off keping the conversation up.

### The game system
The big challenge was the dialogue tree, and i'm still struggling to get it to where i want it to be : easy to feed with content.
