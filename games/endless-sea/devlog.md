At first, I found myself taking charge or the UI and some gameplay features like the investigation board system, and the progress tracking system, along with the gameplay loop game design, and eventually i took over some interaction features and core systems like the radio system, oil rig minigame and others.

We had a lot of brainstorming ideas throughout the first stage of development to figure out what we wanted to implement, the project being a learning experience for many of us, but since everyone was well versed at horror ambiance, we quickly listed the features we needed.

We begun with the basic gameplay loop : 
Select a mission, spawn an item, salvage it through mini games, continue.

Once we had a satisfying enough salvage and navigation loop, we added features like the notebook and investigation board to help the player keep up with the acquired information, and serve as a quest log.

Here, i was experimenting with a *safe room*. Heavily influenced by Resident evil and some of silent hill 2, a room with cold colors, less invasive audio, a place isolated from the rest of the world.

A first attempt at an investigation board, where we place the acquired items and ... investigate them.

Next is an improved version of UI and a the board.

Then, i added a notebook to store the Player Character's notes and thoughts.

Here, i improved the board and linked it to taken notes from the notebook. Also added a sleep feature.

Then we moved onto building the oil rig, the end goal of each game loop, where we had to introduce a new state for the boat and player : "parked state", the player should move outside the boat's boundaries, and every other system must be disabled.

Eventually we moved to a polish before the jam deadline phase, where we improved animations, tackled bugs, and ran through the game a few hundred times to create a satisfying enough first demo.


Fixed the door, and added an animation and new interactable feature.

Built the radio system and linked it to the discovery (spawning and enabling) or the oil rig.
