The team is comprised of myself and a senior Unity developer, a narrative designer and professional writer, a couple of sound and audio engineers, and a 3D artist.

I came to join them as i was searching for people to work with and gain experience, and i was lucky enough to come across the developer who presented me to the rest of the team.

The workflow we follow is similar to the agile / scrum project management i've grown accustomed to through IT projects, where we plan a couple of weeks in advance, collaborate towards a list of must haves, nice to haves and QOL features, discuss on a daily basis our progress and needs, and at each cycle, build a demo and discuss the encountered issues and next goals.

I found myself taking charge or the UI and some gameplay features like the investigation board system, and the progress tracking system, along with the game design around the gameplay loop and the different ways players interact with the game and the presented story.
