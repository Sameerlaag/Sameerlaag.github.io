### Core Concept
You're a lonely seafarer salvaging from wrecks across a poisoned sea in a post apocalyptic world. You start the day by reading through emails and deciding weather or not to accept client commissions, growing weirder and more confusing every time.

The whole plot of the game is exposed through the emails, salvaged items and encounters you make through the short run, which expose the player to the oddly comfortable yet deeply depressing game world, all while drowning the player in a loop of mundane and addicting activities.
