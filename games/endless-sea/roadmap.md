We've continuously established new goals and setup new milestones for our project, what was once a simple 2 people game is actively turning to a game we're expecting to release on steam and try to build a following around.

As of now, we have two main set of goals, long term objectives (steam), and short term objectives (gamejam).

The nautical horror game jam :
* Squash gamebreaking bugs. 
* Enhance the main ending and menus.
* Enhance animations and remove visual glitches.
* Implement more content and create a second ending.


The steam release :
* Rewrite the core systems for a higher quality build and maintenance.
* Migrate to an inventory and equipment system.
* Create modular minigames.
* Add more story content and minigames.
