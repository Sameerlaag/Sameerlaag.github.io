### Core Concept
Take the goofiness of a a party game, into a fast paced shooter heavy on physics and goofy ragdolls, not a game to grind and be competitive but rather a game to play an hour or two every few days over discord. 

The gameplay loop is simple, spawn, pick the ball you want to use, apply an effect if needed (rolling changes velocity and on hit effect and licking the ball prevents parrying), charge and throw it as hard as you can to deal damage until you kill your opponents.
Different balls have different velocities and weights, different damage and can be used in different situations.

Parying a ball allows the player to quickly equip the enemy projectile and nullify damage, making some balls useful at wasting parries.
The american football is the standard and default ball, most balanced in speed / damage.
Base ball and tennis ball are very fast and low on damage and golfball is very small and deals the least damage, they are design to bait parry or waste it.
Basket ball, soccer ball and volleyball have different speeds, faster then the american football, but deal less damage.
Beach ball is very large, very slow, doesn't deal alot of damage but can be used to block the enemy line of sight.
Bowling ball is the slowest projectile in the game, deals enough damage to oneshot an enemy, but very easy to parry. It's like Torbjorn (overwatch) of the balls.
