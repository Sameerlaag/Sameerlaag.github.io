# Lethal Dodgeball - Game Design Document

## Quick Overview

**Lethal Dodgeball** is a chaotic first-person multiplayer shooter where instead of gunning down waves of enemies with gorgeously crafted super realistic guns, you chuck balls at them with a lil bit of strength.

The game was first made for the 20 seconds game jam, where the goal is to design a game loop that must be achieved under 20 seconds maximum, an interesting challenge that i wanted to take part in.
