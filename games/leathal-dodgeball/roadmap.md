### What's going on with the solo version ?
The 20s version was built for the jam and serves as a quick way to test the systems, we'll be using it as such until we reach a high enough quality to apply the changes to multiplayer, and push the improved 20s version with hopefully new game modes.

### Where is the multiplayer ?
The multiplayer build works, like Todd Howard would say, it just works !

Purrnet is very easy to use, and with Gooby having a lot of experience with networking, i found myself quickly absorbing alot of knowledge on the subject. We'll be working on a release when we both find the time to do so and both have polished our skills for a better ragdoll and motion.
