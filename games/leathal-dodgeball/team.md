The team at first was comprised of two developers and a couple of sound engineers.
Through the jam, a new developer specialized in multiplayer join the team, and one of the previous devs left due to a work spike.

As of the release of the first demo, the team was only comprised of myself [Krohnen](https://itch.io/profile/krohnen) and [Gooby](https://goonby.itch.io/).

I handled most of the game loop, while gooby served as a reviewer and worked on the networking side.
