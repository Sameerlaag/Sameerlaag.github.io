# **A Bann Too Many v2**

## **Campaign Overview**

The original campaign, *“Dragon Age: A Bann Too Many,”* suffers, in my opinion, from a lack of direction, emotional dilemmas, and variety of content.

When running it, I’ve decided to add more content inspired by the original Dragon Age game, with characters that should be natural obstacles to some of the PCs while aligning with others.

### ---

## **Themes & Intent**

The main theme is the cycle of violence used to acquire power, and making others suffer for it.

In this alternate take, the town is forced to continue working and struggling to stay afloat while the bandits choke the life out of it.

The banns are infighting in mutual distrust, while the Chantry orchestrates operations to maintain its interests above the lives at stake.

The Gorehands and Blacktail seek to acquire something that the three powers in place seem to be hiding, while strange noises echo from beneath the valley.

## **Colors and flavor**

The ruswold valley is also called the red valley, most trees are coated orange yellow and red, and alot of the stone and wooden houses are decorated with green and blue colors, from the green and blue stones of the rivers.

### ---

## **The Region & Current Crisis**

When the players reach the valley, they’re made aware of the situation: no one has been able to leave for about a month. Perfectly timed bandit attacks have been hitting all caravans and troupes.

If the players’ motives run on a clock, this should force them to intervene and get involved in the plot. Otherwise, they might as well reroll as Blacktail, as the Gorehands won’t let them leave alive.

### ---

## **Factions & Power Structure**

### **The Chantry & Templars**

The Chantry occupies a strong position in the city through an old black stone watchtower that has been reinforced and enlarged. Until the arrival of Lucas, a week after Trumnhall, it had been little more than a typical cathedral.

While some claim Lucas is there to guarantee the success of the cleanup operation, he quickly proves them wrong by building a war room within the tower and declaring himself head of all war forces through a decree of the Chantry. He forces himself into the role of middleman between the Bann, the town’s safety, and the Gorehands.

### ---

### **The Banns**

Krone was stripped of his title and power over the city within months of the bandit occupation, after refusing to ask for help from Ferelden and humbling the former general he is regarded as.

During this time, bandits seized enough control over the valley and forest that by the time reinforcements were ordered and cleanup operations led, they were able to maneuver at will, vanishing without a trace.

Trumnhall arrived a month before the players, sent from Denerim along with his own band of warriors. Through cunning and careful planning, he managed to rebuild the failing walls and keep attacks at bay, while using his charisma and diplomacy to gain recognition from people in power and major voters of the region, quickly becoming the new Bann.

### ---

## **Major NPCs**

### **Sir Lucas, Head Templar**

The first major character is Sir Lucas, Head Templar of the Chantry, sent to the region to maintain order while the torch was being passed from one Bann to another. His main mission is to slay the maleficar Blacktail, believed to be involved with the Gorehand band.

I wrote the character to be a pretentious prick who laughs easily at others’ misfortune, while keeping a straight authoritarian façade when facing his men and civilians. He weaponizes distrust and fear, portraying himself as a power-hungry monarch, which, in his view, is how a Head Templar should be perceived.

The idea is to create a cliché character who’s easy to dislike, but who, by the end of the story, might get the players switching sides.

He will sacrifice men, women, and children to accomplish his mission, believing strongly in the teachings of the Chantry: that maleficarum can unleash hells upon the living, and that all must be done to prevent it. He truly believes in his way, his unbreakable will, and his keen military talent.

Lucas truly believes he is the only one willing to do what must be done.

He sees the valley not as a community, but as a powder keg—one miscast spell away from annihilation. Every civilian death is tragic, but acceptable. Every sacrifice is justified, so long as the world does not burn, and when he finds an opportunity to cast the citizen away safely he does so, losing a bargaining chip, but negotiating with maleficar was never an option.

Lucas does not hate mages, despite making it look so, he fears what happens when no one is willing to stop them. and thus his cruelty is deliberate, his arrogance is armor. He believes kindness breeds hesitation, and hesitation breeds catastrophe. If he must be remembered as a monster to prevent something worse, so be it.

He’s accompanied by two sidekicks and underlings: Albert the mute, and Charlie, who cannot, for the grace of Andraste, shut up.

The two serve as comedic relief. Charlie constantly tells stupid stories, speaks for Albert, and talks about him, visibly annoying Albert, who has grown to simply let it go. This dynamic can later become a strong emotional moment.

Oh and he truly cares for his two subordinates.

### ---

### **Bann Trumnhall**

Trumnhall is painted as a *justice-first* landless lord. He worked hard to earn his position ruling over Rustwold and plans to be both a strong leader and a fair, benevolent humanist. He fights rampant racism, seeks to unify the people, and aims to build a strong city to support the country.

Deep down, he loathes the Chantry and the current monarchy of Ferelden, hates nobles and courtesy, eats with his bare hands, and bends the law whenever he sees fit—often making a spectacle of it if it earns him more followers.

I’ve seeded signs of manipulative behavior by having him let others speak first, adapting his tone and point of view to gain support, even if he has to lie. As long as it’s for the greater good, he can apologize later.

He genuinely wants Rustwold to thrive, and that only he can make that happen, if that means lying, manipulating, or sacrificing ideals, so be it—ideals don’t feed cities.

What he refuses to confront is how close he is to becoming the very tyrant he despises.

### ---

### **Ciaran**

I added a side character to Bann Trumnhall: an oversized, in every sense of the term, human meat shield and personal executioner—Ciaran.

Ciaran was saved from a cage and a death sentence a few years ago and has followed Trumnhall ever since, earning the nickname of Trumnhall’s second-favorite lapdog.

Ciaran is meant to be the Bann’s muscle and another source of comedic relief. He often over-exaggerates his behavior, sets up needless torture devices, and joyfully asks the players to bring enemies to him alive, smiling broadly in stark contrast with the grim camp ambiance.

He enjoys breaking his victims and is often disappointed when it’s “too easy.” He only finds himself in a position of power due to his debt to the Bann and is therefore not allowed to break the law. He frightens soldiers and peasants alike but never openly antagonizes anyone.

### ---

### **Bann Krone**

I kept Krone mostly the same as in the book, making him more jaded, pitiful, and authoritarian. Everyone around him has abandoned him for Trumnhall.

He is paranoid and despises the two new authorities towering over him. He refuses to relinquish his family manor to the new Bann, even though he sold it to the town and acquired a fortune from the resulting investments.

I portrayed Krone as a separatist from the country, believing he stole the land from the Chasnid. He wishes to live in peace with them, but continues the aggression to maintain the economy of war and keep the crown’s funds flowing.

### ---

## **The Gorehand Bandits & Blacktail**

The Gorehand bandits appeared out of nowhere a few months ago in Rustwold. They began assaulting travelers and merchants, leaving some alive to tell the tale.

As the valley fought back, they quickly took control of the hills, rivers, and woods, setting up camps and safe roads. They organized themselves like a real army, capable of withstanding and eventually overpowering the former Bann’s forces.

This is what reached the capital, prompting the sending of Trumnhall and Lucas, under the belief that the enemy was weaponizing magic or Chasnid knowledge to weaken the region.

By the time they arrived, the bandits controlled most roads. Whenever one was freed, another was taken. Supplies were cut off, and the town was subjected to killing, theft, and terror to force its leader to surrender and accept the terms of a parley.

A bandit leader seeking parley is never a good sign. They want something—and it must be important.

### **Blacktail**

Blacktail is not any maleficar, he was born in Orlais a rare hybrid between elves and humans. He took over the Gorehand group from Woldrick by blackmailing him with a cure to his granddaughter’s sickness, forcing him out of retirement to serve as the threat that brings Ruswold into his hands.

During his youth was captured and pulled into a tortuous existence of servitude under the Orlaisian nobility. Seeking to use the young one’s unique existence to bend down the fade, he was put through the ritual of masks and mirrors to shatter his mind and capture the essence of a demon into a vessel that harbors the strengths of both races.

But blacktail dominated the demon of desire, and made him a pawn and weapon, devouring the nobility, and began seeking a way to empower himself further, in order to devour the fade and make himself the god that will reconcile the two worlds.

Pretty gloomy and edgy, which is why i prefer to use him as a long campaign villain, like a Lastleaf from Kings of the Wyld.

### ---

## **Major Events Timeline**

### **The Krones**

Some men in armor may attempt to shake down the players for a “rite of passage” near Krone Manor. These men were hired as security after Krone lost power—mercenaries who happened to be present but take their role far too seriously.

They can be found drinking at the local tavern, pushing others around and making their unpopularity well known.

### ---

### **The Banquet**

A banquet is held to mark the beginning of Bann Trumnhall’s rule. All inhabitants, including the previous Bann, are invited.

Krone will, of course, not attend, instead inviting the players to his manor to discuss arrangements and apologize for his men’s behavior.

The goal is to introduce the characters to the town’s major figures and allow Trumnhall to give a speech addressing the issues choking the region’s lifeblood.

### ---

### **The Coordinated Attacks**

During the banquet, the bandits strike.

A horde assaults the lumberjack camp, aiming to destroy the shipment before it reaches the wagons. During the attack, they capture as many people as possible, including PCs if the opportunity arises.

Another group attacks Krone Manor, seeking to acquire *what he’s hiding*.

If the players split, attend the banquet, or visit Krone, combat should be run simultaneously.

### ---

### **A Seemingly Random Merchant Ambush**

A bandit attack hits caravans entering the region. One caravan should escape, while the others fall to the Gorehands before the players can intervene.

This exposes several truths:

* The Gorehands capture people rather than kill them, unless making a statement or exacting revenge.

* They know the contents of certain caravans, targeting specific goods even after wagons fall into rivers.

* If players recover the loot in time, they find strange dwarven tools.

### ---

### **Lumberjack Camp Encounter**

The ambush is straightforward—arrows and blades—but one element may intervene depending on how well the players fare.

Blacktail appears: a dark-skinned elf with a long black braid, tattoos covering one side of his head and face, and a strange tunic exposing half his torso opposite the tattoos.

He uses an invisibility tunic, weaving in and out of combat to disrupt powerful opponents.

### ---

### **Manor Krone Assault**

Assassins infiltrate the manor and set it ablaze. If players push inside and defeat several attackers, an identical Blacktail appears and engages them.

If a player fits the narrative mold, Blacktail stings them with a black dagger, immediately tainting them and introducing the Tainted mechanic.

This Blacktail clone searches for documents regarding the secret trade, intending to continue acquiring dwarven tools after disposing of his former puppet, while framing the remaining leaders as culprits.

### He also steals a stone tablet displayed as decoration, originally taken from the Chasnid. It contains a map of the underground tunnels he wants to keep hidden from the players.  **Aftermath**

After Manor Krone is burned down, whether Krone is alive or dead will lead to different relationships and levels of trust developing with Lucas and Trumnhall. Krone believes the two are in cahoots with the bandits to seize his lands, while the other two no longer trust anyone, and the situation is about to worsen.

Krone, or the exploration of the remains of the manor, will reveal his dirty secret to the players: he’s been working with certain merchants to smuggle products into his town tax-free. That pipeline is still active, and that merchant is most likely stuck in the region along with the players.

The information the players acquire from the merchant is that he has been frequently handling dwarven tools over the last month at the request of the Bann. Which Bann? He doesn’t know and doesn’t care. The tools are meant to be deposited at the Great Hollow Tree, a location most people ignore, despite the large hollow space within the tree where items can easily be stored.

### ---

### **Exploration & Investigation Paths**

### **Keeping It Open**

I like to let players figure out ways to outsmart the bandits—methods that Blacktail’s magic cannot see or predict. This also allows them to learn more about how his abilities work and what he is capable of.

All bandits bear a carved rune; it’s Orlesian in origin and allows Blacktail to know exactly where they are, as if he were playing chess. On top of that, he has insiders—possibly one of the three leaders, or perhaps people the players met at the banquet.

If the players manage to find a bandit hideout, they discover mines and underground alleys: a labyrinth beneath the valley that none of the three rulers knew about, but that the original inhabitants of the land—the Chasnid—do. The leaders of the Gorehands must be among them.

### ---

### **The Kidnappings and Prisoners**

One lead the players can follow is determining where the captured people are taken and where the stolen resources are stored. This can lead to encounters with Chasnid hunters searching for peers kidnapped by the same bandits.

This path can develop into a tracking and exploration session that leads the party to a bandit camp—raising alarms, uncovering clues, eliminating potential holding sites, and pinpointing where a decisive assault against the bandits could take place.

### ---

### **The Watchtower Ritual**

One way I introduce a new character is by having the Chantry order a mage from the tower to perform a ritual capable of spreading a presence across the region, detecting the communication network used by Blacktail and revealing his location.

I let the dice decide whether Blacktail notices the ritual or whether a PC passes out during it, creating three possible outcomes. Each allows the players to approach the bandit hideout in a different way.

I also use this ritual as a way to introduce Blacktail’s Inner World.

### ---

### **Exploring the Mines**

Discovering the mines and their layout will vary depending on previous events. Lucas will order the players to follow this lead, doing so in his usual prickish manner, making it sound like a suicide mission before ordering his two henchmen to accompany them.

The two templars will work cohesively with the PCs, while one constantly talks about how he isn’t afraid of water—he just doesn’t like it very much.

The caves and corridors are claustrophobic, making them ideal for monster spider nests. The players will find traces of human passage that even the rain cannot erase.

The PCs should not be allowed to rest here. Monsters roam the tunnels, and their sense of smell is strong.

After several vertical exploration moments, the party reaches an underground lake, with a large natural stone bridge leading to a deeper cavern illuminated by a dim light.

This is a perfect arena for a monster battle that risks death by drowning.  
If no player falls here and they struggle to create tension, have it be one of the templars instead. Underwater monsters drag him under and devour him, allowing the players to proceed.

Beyond this point, the mines resemble a dwarven city more than a natural cave or mining site.

### ---

### **Blacktail’s Inner World**

This is where my love for psychological horror bleeds fully into the story. The area is filled with cages, strange plants, and a dim light emanating from deeper within. The lake monsters continue to pursue the players.

Sounds of footsteps and voices echo. The monsters vanish, but a massive, grotesque egg blocks the bridge.

Whoever fell—or Blacktail himself if no one did—appears in the form of a child, wandering innocently and looking for someone to talk to.

If the loud-mouthed templar who feared water drowned, the child appears soaked and terrified, asking the players for help while mean children mock him for not knowing how to swim.  
(This hints at why Blacktail hates water.)

If the other templar fell, the child does not speak at all and violently recoils from touch.

If a player fell, choose a trauma from that character’s backstory and relive it through this scene.

The players may be tempted to kill the clearly demonic child. Whatever they decide, ensure that whenever someone looks away, becomes distracted, or separates from the group, they find themselves alone in a darker, dimmer version of the same place—eventually wandering onto a snowy mountaintop fortress far from where they began.

The party will eventually regroup after awakening in the snow fortress. They notice corpses half-buried in snow, rocks being pushed and pulled by unseen forces, massive crows watching both the land and the players, and Orlesian banners hanging throughout the hollowed structure.

If a player fell earlier, they may still be played during this section.

Exploration leads inside the fortress, where a massive statue of Andraste towers over the area. Above, on an unreachable upper floor, robed and masked figures dance, their necks bound by chains that descend into the cellar.

The only path forward leads beneath the statue, down spiral stairs into a vast chamber of chains and hanging cages. At its center stands a small, box-shaped cage lined with mirrors.

Within the mirrors, the players see an alternate version of the same chamber, where a ritual is taking place. The figure conducting it is Blacktail.

This initiates a boss fight against a Demon of Desire—an oversexualized butterfly with vibrant wings and a pale humanoid body resembling Blacktail.

### ---

### **The Second Hatchling**

Defeating the demon pulls the players out of Blacktail’s Inner World—a place in the Fade where the demon absorbed them in an attempt to claim their minds and bodies.

The party awakens and is reunited in a more abandoned version of the dungeon. If they are fortunate, no one discovered them during their unconsciousness, and they benefited from the rest if the DM wishes so.

Continuing forward leads them to one of the locations where prisoners are held, forced to use dwarven tools to mine red lyrium from the heart of the Red Valley.

If no bandits found and relocated the party, the drowned character—they died organically—appears, now possessed by the Demon of Desire, initiating the boss fight once more. This version blends the character’s fighting style with demonic abilities.

If the drowned templar who feared water appears, the demon takes the form of a radiant, proud templar claiming to protect the weak and slaughter the cruel. He “heals” the templar’s trauma, allowing him to speak again—only for the templar to realize this is not his brother-in-arms and immediately attack.

If the other templar appears, a demonic butterfly humanoid with no mouth emerges, its skin resembling templar armor and wielding a similar weapon.

If a player drowned and died organically, i’d have the new PC (hoping they rerolled) fight along the party against the demonic one. A perfect opportunity to introduce a character here is to release a prisoner from their mind and physical chains.  
I’d keep the demon toying with a drownd player if you deem it not worthy killing off a PC for such a scene, now stuck in a tug of war for control of their mind.

### 

## **Final Confrontation**

### **The political conflict**

At this point in time, the Watchtower ritual must have disturbed the maleficar’s communications, meaning the ground should be even for their operations to succeed, but as Lucas sends the party to the mines without consulting the Bann, a similar operation is taking place on the main roads to denerim, this one aiming for a flash operation aiming to slaughter Woldryck in his main hideout, but before the operation can begin, multiple battalions are ambushed at the same time and left alone in his watch tower at night, Ciaran comes for his head.

At this point Lucas was already doubting Trumnhall and keeping things from him, but for the sake of this operation, he let him know, and no one else to make of him the prime suspect in case of trahision, and trahison was.

This is what Lucas will tell the players as they return to what now looks like a warzone, a hollow barricaded town, the people have left massively escorted by a fraction of Lucas’ remaining forces. Now leading the town, he chased Trumnhall away and kept half his men whose faith lied in the Templar. (Krone if alive can now rest assured and await his position back).

The players might oppose Lucas and distrust him, and seek the Bann for further questioning, what should come by now is a lead to the end of the story, one of the parties trusted by the player will receive an invitation to the pourparler as *the representatives of Krone*.

All parties are aware that what the Gorehand seek are manpower to mine the lyrium and smuggled tools, the people leaving force the bandits to either pull their strengths to capture more or protect themselves from the now divided distrusting opposing bann and head templar.

### **The Pourparler**

Woldryck, Lucas, and Trumnhall meet in an abandoned reserve, their troops ready to strike, attempting to talk things out until the players arrive with their newly discovered leads on the demonic mage.

Each party wants something.  
Gorehand wants access to the mines for a week, after which they will withdraw and release the hostages.  
Trumnhall wants the hostages freed and the region made safe.  
Lucas wants the maleficar and the red lyrium.

Whichever side the party chooses will determine the outcome, along with their input.

Any outcome that doesn’t go Lucas’ way has him leave in anger, only to immediately lead a strike on the Gorehand forces as the party and the Bann’s men engage in battle.

There was never going to be a treaty.  
You can’t take the word of a snake.  
And the snake’s head will be cut off in this fight.

---

### **What Comes After**

With their chief down, one might expect the bandits to scatter, but instead some of them consume a red powder drug and turn monstrous and superhuman, erupting into a deadly final battle.

The Bann is forced to flee, while Lucas—if still alive—stays with the party to ensure their survival.

While waiting for the red-lyrium-infused bandits to die off, a temporary camp is established underground, using the same labyrinth once occupied by the bandits as shelter.

Here, the players are faced with one last choice:  
Who, between Lucas and Trumnhall, is the traitor?  
Who has been sheltering Blacktail?

If Lucas loses the debate, he turns on the players, engaging them in combat—only for Ciaran to deliver the final blow.

Revealed to be under Blacktail’s control, Ciaran consumes red lyrium and transforms, fighting the players while the Bann falls unconscious and the war hound takes its true form.

All his enemies are now down. He can easily pin the blame for the Gorehand alliance on them. All that remains is to kill the players, continue mining in secret and escape with the precious red lyrium.

Whether he loses or flees (I prefer him as a recurring villain), the fight ends with the players holding all the keys and knowing the full truth.

Most civilians have fled. The region will soon be safe, and reinforcements will arrive within days to tend to the wounded and begin rebuilding.
