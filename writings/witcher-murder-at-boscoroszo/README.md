The follwing is the summary to a ttrpg story that i'm currently writing, and while still a work in progress i do enjoy hearing feedback about what currently is available. 

This story is ment to be both standalone and part of a series — connections to other episodes will be **marked** so one can decide weather to include them or not.  
The word _might_ is often used, since player choice shapes what they learn (or not). Bear with me as I lay out the pieces: they’ll only make full sense when they’re revealed in play, as the players are meant to uncover them.

### Hunt the witcher
#### The pitch

Unlike the witcher books and games, the story doesn't follow a monster hunter, but your average adventurer and common-man chasing after a most terrifying predator.
Written as a series of episodes, each one is meant to push the character to develop further while getting them closer and closer to their prey in a game cat and mouse, which turns gradually into chess (or Gwent if you prefer).

If you, who reads and plans to use this story as a setting see yourself going a one shot story, you can present this as the final episode of the hunt, in which your PCs whill have already bonded and grown, and thus have your players image what would the long story been.

Ideally you want each member of the party to have a reason to hunt Fazil, duty often doesn't suffice if not entangled with personal feelings, those are my feelings at least on making an adventure feel personal, especially when the setting is as deadly as the witcher world.

The format i like to follow when creating prefabs :
- the revenger, who seeks revenge on wrong doings (and boy did Fazil wrong people)
- the victim (who was wronged, mirrors the selfish side of the revenger)
- the seeker of knowledge (who seeks what Fazil has and knows for selfish reasons)
- the dying (who wants to save himself or loved ones with Fazil's research)
- the savior (who cares and preserves about the region, the world, or whatever got entangled into this hunt )
- the loved one (who mirrors the savior by caring about Fazil or wanting to stop him)

### Murder at Boscoroszo
#### The premise

The party follows the trail of Fazil, a rogue witcher whose tracks lead away from the sun-drenched vineyards of Beauclair toward the jagged eastern cliffs of Boscoroszo. On the winding ascent through the hills and woods, the air changes as the vibrant flora of Toussaint turns sickly; The heavy smell of decaying flesh and putrid beasts feeding on it pulls their sight off the roads down through the ditches, where they find the remains of a caravan and mangled bodies—one of them the heir to MaisonRouge, torn beyond recognition.

They arrive at the sole town of Boscoroszo, a beautiful labyrinth of pale stone houses clinging to a precipice above a rushing river. It is dressed with flowers and trees coated in red and orange, a place that once served as a prosperous venue for traders from beyond the border. Now, it is an aging fortress of locked doors, echoes, and whispers of fear and discontent.

A couple of nights before, the witcher came into this very same town.

_"That freak with golden eyes walked across the bridge at sunset like a common traveler,"_ the locals say. _"By moonrise, we heard Gisele scream and found her boy dead. The prison walls blew up and the bandit chief vanished. Our guards in their shiny boots were too busy polishing their spears to stop him. Now, we bury our sons while the Baronne hides in her manse, fattening like a pig."_

Tensions boil across the agitated land. With the strange deaths occurring and the witcher seemingly freeing prisoners before fleeing into the night, the party thus must understand his hand in this business and continue their chase—all under the unblinking eyes of the town's owls.

#### The larger picture

Arriving in town, the players learn Fazil murdered the alchemist’s only son, sparking the chaos that followed and distracted just enough to free a local bandit chief and flee with him into the northern forests. The townsfolk want blood, and thus a bounty will be set for the head of Fazil and the bandits, hoping to calm the unrest.
Looking further into the agitation and the bandits, the players can learn of a botched heist that occurred a few weeks earlier, leading to the arrest of the chief.

The pack of renegades called *Les chiens sauvages*, attempted to ransack the Boscoroszo - MaisonRouge burial vault, allegedly keeping treasures and ornaments, but got mangled and torn to pieces to what the chief claims to be a monstrous Owl beast coinciding with the rural folklore believing the town is under the watch of owls.
Thus, the chief let himself be captured, terrified of said beast, expecting protection within the prison walls, only to be sentenced to death when the sword was found gone.

Eventually the players will traverse the hills and woods looking to find the witcher and bandits, regardless of weather they intend to address their situation or not since they're seemingly their best lead. Through the century old battlefields now home to monsters, they come across villagers managing to survive in these wilds, seemingly navigating through the red bosquet's traps and beasts like sailors under a clear sky, slowly revealing what might pivot the way they address the political compass.

(this extra part is a link to another episode, and a tension reliefer off the events of the story, feel free to ignore )
**While tracking, the players might encounter [[Leslie]], searching for her missing friend — allegedly kidnapped by a witcher. If the party has a witcher, she might mistake him for the culprit and attack.** *([[Leslie]] is an important asset for the next adventure, but also a key to the end of this one that the player should not grasp, read through her page and [[Fazil]]'s plan to improve or redact depending on what how you want to use this campaign)*
(end of the extra)

The bandits they track turn out not to be mere criminals. Their traps and raids target mostly foreign merchants, border patrols, and nobles. The players might learn they are former mercenaries or poor peasants — working in secret with local rulers, stirring unrest to justify border taxes and raiding rich merchants. A kind of orchestrated Robin Hoodism, justified by the constant economical foreign pressure.

A few weeks before, these bandits raided the MaisonRouge vault, tasked by none other than the first corpse the party saw on their arrival, Eduardo, heir to the lands, who had sent them to steal the family sword from sire Claude’s grave, his own grandfather and town founder.
None returned, thus they believe they were setup to be disposed of, turning the people against them, and kill the flames of the sparking revolt.

Fazil on the other hand heard of an owl like beast haunting the region, rumors of a cursed family, which coincides with one of the leads he has on his own quest, thus embarked on a journey to startle the region and throw oil to the fire hoping to lay hands on whatever power hidden between the red trees.

Figuring what happened with the sword, means understanding the motivations of Eduardo, uncovering his hidden romantic involvement, with one who lurks in Boscoroszo's shadows, and runs a conspiracy to take down Alice.

Thus the story unfolds in what i see being three major parts :
- Arriving, acclimating to, and learning about the on goings of Boscoroszo.
- Weather a side is taken or not, start the hunt for the witcher and/or the bandit pack.
- Discover Fazil's goals, and either
    - Reveal the truth and stop the massacres at the risk of losing track of Fazil.
    - Work with one of the 3 sides of the conflict, and confront Fazil .
    - Remain neutral, and join the hunt to acquire the sword while being preyed upon by the Owl.

#### reveals and secrets (wip)

The **secret of Boscoroszo**: the barony was never won in noble battle. Instead, they struck a pact with a [[mysterious individual]] who sealed it upon the once young warrior's sword. Bound to that sword was a beast — a monstrous owl [[Hibou]] that would guard their lands, slaughter the enemies of the region, and unbeknownst to them condemn its owners to eternal battle and endless conflict.

When sire Claude died of old age, the pact passed to his son. It crushed him under its curse. After him came Alice, who grew cold hearted and cynical and paranoid as she lost her husband, the people’s trust, and then her own children, to who she believed to be spies and assassins of foreign affairs, never realizing that while no blade ever got to her throat, there is a beast keeping hers close to her.

Her sheltered grandson [[Eduardo]] dreamed of escape to become an adventurer, a poet, and artist. But fate bound him to [[Markusz]], lover and betrayer, who convinced him to plot the theft of his grandfather’s sword for their own benefit.

*Take the seat, free the people, free yourself, free me, and we'll leave and travel the world far from political nonsense.*

The beast mauled the bandits Eduardo had commanded, then tracked and killed the heir of the lands himself as he tried to flee. Setting up the process a weakened estate, a perfect motion for Fazil to swoop in, and start a fire that would eventually free the beast and allow him to capture the sword, or at least keep it busy enough.

So what does Fazil have to do with all of this ?

His goal is the sword, or rather the beast bound to it by magic ...
Just like the party, he's tracking someone, an alchemist who died a century ago but left a mark on the world of monstrous mutations. As he ventured through the remains of his laboratories, battled and put to rest his creations, he found the story of traces of an otherworldly castle, gated by the madman's two favorite pets [[Leslie]] and [[Hibou]]. A novel that mirrors what the madman was seeking in his experiments, and that Fazil believes to be the key to the immortal body he wishes to acquire.

He knows from his findings that neither beast can be killed or bested at combat, so he lurks and conspires, goading others to do the work for him, until he can safely get his hands on the sword and take control over the monster.

This episode concentrates on him trying to get his hands on Hibou, so if you're running this as one shot, prehaps omitting Leslie altogether and the whole alchemist thing is for the better. Fazil is looking for maddening power, and will acquire the sword or die trying.

The players have two main leads to find the rogue witcher:

* Plunge into the woods and track the bandits, which opens up:
    * Discovering who the bandits are, and what they're after.
    * The way they function, their lair, and how to deal with them.
    * The trails of traps left by Fazil, and his interaction with Leslie.
- Investigate his involvement in the town business, which leads with:
    - Obtaining information about the bandits and their recent activities.
    - Looking into the disappeared sword and the recent deaths.
    - Tracking Eduardo's last steps.
      Depending on how they lead the investigation, the owl monster might label them a threat to the lands and lords, and start hunting them every night, making the third act of this game a survival game.

The party will figure out that Fazil's involvement is not just a whim or a jest, but both a carefully planned heist and an opportunity for them to force him out of the shadows to face their wrath.

While both Alice and Markusz try to win the party’s support, the order of events and discoveries made by the players determines which side they pick, leading them to a confrontation that settles the conflict regardless of the undiscovered truth, but also allows Fazil to reach his goals, as the one information the players are missing will allow him to escape once more.

This story is meant to end as we establish the calculating and manipulative nature of our Rogue Witcher, but feel free to have the players kill or let him go if you wish to end the campaign. (i do feel the ending would be unsatisfying if he got caught without being the center of the story)

The story ending depends on interpretation and loyalty, for example :

- Recover the sword and fight the beast in Alice’s name.
- Or turn against Alice herself and cast her and the curse to oblivion.
- Side with Markusz and allow him to leave with the sword, or use him as bait for the beast.

Beyond this, the GM can add content to suite the type of players at their table, the two paths mimick the two Witcher 3 players in my opinion, but also offers alot of character progress and expression potential for your seasoned TTRPG player.

The first part of the story is [[Adventure begins]].
